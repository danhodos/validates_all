ValidatesAll
============

Extends the built-in ActiveRecord Validations to add a "validates_all" method which is similar to "validates_each". This is often useful when wanting to validate one attribute against another or against a set. Example:

  class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
    validates_all :security_answer_1, :security_answer_2 do |record, attrs, values|
      message = '#{attrs.to_sentence(:connector => 'or')} must be set'
      record.errors.add_to_base(message) if attrs.all?(&:blank?)
    end
  end

Furthermore, it adds a few validations built on top of "validates_all", including:
 * "validates_presence_of_one_of" (aliased as "validates_presence_of_either"): encapsulates the pattern where at least one of a set of attributes has to be specified, and
 * "validates_different": encapsulates the pattern where two specified attributes must be different from each other

Example:

  class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
    validates_presence_of_either :login_name, :email_address
    validates_different :password, :old_password
  end
  
See the comments in lib/validates_all.rb for options that can be passed to each of these methods.
